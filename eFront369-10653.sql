The Floyd algorithm solves this problem. This algorithm is an expansion of another algorithm, the Warshall algorithm, who was first defined for the solution of another problem:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			In a digraph G (whether there are costs or not, is of no importance) find whether there is a route from V(i) to V(j), for all pairs of (i,j), i&lt;&gt;j.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			To solve this problem we find an array A. The elements of this array are A(i,j)=1 if there is a route from i to j, otherwise A(i,j)=0. Because the cost is not important we define the Adjoining Array as if all the costs were 1 that means C(i,j)=1 if there is eij belonging to E and otherwise C(i,j)=0. The requested array A is called transitive closure of the Adjoining Array.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			We notice that the elements of the A array are Boolean variables(0 or 1), which means that the operations AND and OR are valid. The Warshall algorithm initializes the A array at the value of C:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			A(i,j)=C(i,j), i,j=1,...,n<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			At this point the A array shows only the direct connections as existing routes. Then the algorithm goes through the A array n times, one time for every node k=1,....,n. For every node V(k) the main thinking is : Is there a route from V(i) to V(j), if it has already been found {that is A(i,j)=1] or if a route is found through V(k), that is if the routes from V(i) to V(k) and from V(k) to V(j)[that is if A(i,k)=1 and A(k,j)=1].\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<em><strong>\r\n			If the BOOLEAN characteristics of the elements of A are taken under consideration, then the rule in the k pass is:<br />\r\n			A(i,j)=A(i,j) OR {A(i,k) AND A(k,j) }.</strong></em><br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			We now come back to the m.r. problem for all pairs. This time we are talking about a graph, and the Adjoining Array is defined by the costs C(i,j)=c(eij). The A array will finally consist of all the costs of the minimum routes.<br />\r\n			During the k pass the following formula is valid:<br />\r\n			A(i,j)=min{A(i,j),A(i,k) + A(k,j) }<br />\r\n			which means that if the route through V(k) is cheaper will be the winner.

A salesman must visit n cities, passing through each city only once, beginning from one of them which is considered as his base, and returning to it. The cost of the transportation among the cities (whichever combination possible) is given. The program of the journey is requested, that is the order of visiting the cities in such a way that the cost is the minimum.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Let&#39;s number the cities from 1 to n, and let city 1 be the city-base of the salesman. Also let&#39;s assume that c(i,j) is the visiting cost from i to j. There can be c(i,j)&lt;&gt;c(j,i). Apparently all the possible solutions are (n-1)! Someone could probably determine them systematically, find the cost for each and everyone of these solutions and finally keep the one with the minimum cost. These requires at least (n-1)! steps.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			If for example there were 21 cities the steps required are (n-1)!=(21-1)!=20! steps. If every step required a msec we would need about 770 centuries of calculations. Apparently, the exhausting examination of all possible solutions is out of the question. Since we are not aware of any other quick algorithm that finds a best solution we will use a heuristic algorithm. According to this algorithm whenever the salesman is in town i he chooses as his next city, the city j for which the c(i,j) cost is the minimum among all c(i,k) costs, where k are the pointers of the city the salesman has not visited yet. There is also a simple rule just in case more than one cities give the minimum cost, for example in such a case the city with the smaller k will be chosen. This is a greedy algorithm which selects in every step the cheapest visit and does not care whether this will lead to a wrong result or not. \r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 8, 1, 1170259174, 'theory', 1, 8, 'b:0;', NULL, NULL, 1, ''),

For this reason the examination and produce of the solutions follows a model of non-cycle graph for which in this case we will consider as a tree. The root of the tree represents the set of all the solutions. Nodes in lower levels represent even smaller sets of solutions, based on their properties. Obviously, leaves will be isolated solutions. It is easily understood that the tree (or any other graph) is produced during the examination of the solutions so that no rejected solutions are produced. When a node is rejected, the whole sub-tree is rejected, and we backtrack to the ancestor of the node so that more children are produced and examined. Because this method is expected to produce subsets of solutions which are difficult to process, the method itself is not very popular.\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<h2>THE QUEENS PROBLEM</h2>\r\n			We consider a grid of squares, dimensioned nXn, partly equivalent to a chessboard containing n2 places. A queen placed in any of the n2 squares controls all the squares that are on its row, its column and the 450 diagonals. The problem asked, is how to put n queens on the chessboard, so that the square of every queen is not controlled by any other queen. Obviously for n=2 there is no problem to the solution, while for n=4 a valid solution is given by the drawing below. <br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			<font size="2"><img src="content/lessons/1/kef5_81.jpg" border="0" hspace="0" align="middle" /></font><br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			A possible position on the grid is set by the pair of pointers (i,j) where 1(1),...V(n)]. All the solutions for which V(i)=V(j) are rejected because 2 queens can not be on the same row.Now the solutions are the permutes of n pointers, which is n!, still a forbiddingly big number. Out of all these solution the correct one is the one which satisfies the last requirement: 2 queens will not belong in the same diagonal, which is:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			V(j)-V(i)&lt;&gt;±(i-j) for i&lt;&gt;j. (5.8-1)<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			A backtracking algorithm or this problem constructs the permutes [V(1),....V(n)] of the {1,...,n} pointers, and examines them as to the property (5.8-1). For example there are (n-2)! permutes in the shape of [3,4....]. These will not be produced and examined if the systematically construction of them has already ordered them in a sub-tree with root [3,4] which will be rejected by the 5.8-1 condition, and will also reject all the (n-2)! permutes. On the contrary, the same way of producing-examining will go even further to the examination of more permutes in the shape of p={1,4,2,...} since, so far the condition is satisfied. The next node to be inserted that is j:=V(4) must also satisfies these:j-1&lt;&gt;3,j-4&lt;&gt;2,j-4&lt;&gt;-2,j-2&lt;&gt;1,j-2&lt;&gt;-1. All the j pointers satisfying these requirements produce the following permutes: [1,4,2,j,...] which connect to the tree as children of p. Meanwhile large sets of permutes such as [1,4,2,6,...] have already been rejected.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			A typical declaration of this algorithm: The root of all solutions,has as children n nodes [1],...,[n],where [j] represents all the permutes starting with j(and whose number is (n-1)! for every j).

This happens because all costs are considered as positive numbers. In this way the first route D(1) found by the algorithm will be one arc route, that is from the starting point to one of the sides directly connected to this starting point. The next route D(2) will be a one arc route itself, or a two arc route, but in this case will be an expansion of D(1).

For each and everyone of those projects there is a deadline d(i)&gt;0 which is an integer number of time units and a profit p(i)&gt;0 which is gained only if the project is fulfilled before the exceeded of the deadline. The execution of a project (any of them) requires a time unit. Which projects and in what order should be constructed in order to maximize the total profit?<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			An expectable or possible solution for this problem is a set of projects which can all be constructed before their deadline in a certain order, but not necessarily with their order of appearance in the set. If for example we consider n=3, (d(1),d(2),d(3)=2,2,1) and (p(1),p(2),p(3))=(50,100,60) a possible solution is the following set:L={E(1),E(2)} with a total profit of 150, whereas another possible solution(which happens to be the best) is the : L{E(2),E(3)}, with order of construction E(3) first, followed by E(2).

This algorithm will add the project to the L set, if it still gives us a possible solution. To check whether the overadded solution still is possible the algorithm should logically check all the possible transpositions of the elements of the solution. If in the present step there are k elements in the candidate possible solution, the algorithm would have to check k! cases in the worst case, a number forbiddingly big. However, there is a way out of this problem because we must only try to transfer projects with inclining deadline order. If this execution order aborts our deadlines we do not add this new project in our solution, and a new project (one with the maximum profit) is selected out of the remaining projects.

The rituals and ceremonies were very closely associated with celestial/terrestrial cycles which they observed and inscribed as separate calendars. The Maya priest had the job of interpreting these cycles and giving a prophetic outlook on the future or past based on the number relations of all their calendars. They also had to determine if the &quot;heavens&quot; or celestial matters were appropriate for performing certain religious ceremonies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Maya practiced human sacrifice. In some Maya rituals people were killed by having their arms and legs held while a priest cut the person&#39;s chest open and tore out his heart as an offering. This is depicted on ancient objects such as pictorial texts, known as codecs. It is believed that children were often offered as sacrificial victims because they were believed to be pure.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMuch of the Maya religious tradition is still not understood by scholars, but it is known that the Maya, like most pre-modern societies, believed that the cosmos has three major planes, the underworld, the sky, and the earth.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Maya Underworld is reached through caves and ball courts. It was thought to be dominated by the aged Maya gods of death and putrefaction. The Sun and Itzamna, both aged gods, dominated the Maya idea of the sky. The night sky was considered a window showing all supernatural doings. The Maya configured constellations of gods and places, saw the unfolding of narratives in their seasonal movements, and believed that the intersection of all possible worlds was in the night sky.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMaya gods were not discrete, separate entities like Greek gods. The gods had affinities and aspects that caused them to merge with one another in ways that seem unbounded. There is a massive array of supernatural characters in the Maya religious tradition, only some of which recur with regularity. Good and evil traits are not permanent characteristics of Maya gods, nor is only &quot;good&quot; admirable. What is inappropriate during one season might come to pass in another since much of the Mayan religious tradition is based on cycles and not permanence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe life-cycle of maize lies at the heart of Maya belief. This philosophy is demonstrated on the Maya belief in the Maize God as a central religious figure. The Maya bodily ideal is also based on the form of the young Maize God, which is demonstrated in their artwork. The Maize God was also a model of courtly life for the Classical Maya.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Maya believed that the universe was flat and square, but infinite in area. They also worshiped the circle, which symbolized perfection or the balancing of forces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is sometimes believed that the multiple &quot;gods&quot; represented nothing more than a mathematical explanation of what they observed. Each god was literally just a number or an explanation of the effects observed by a combination of numbers from multiple calendars. Among the many types of Maya calendars which were maintained, the most important included a 260-day cycle, a 365-day cycle which approximated the solar year, a cycle which recorded lunation periods of the Moon, and a cycle which tracked the synodic period of Venus.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPhilosophically, the Maya believed that knowing the past meant knowing the cyclical influences that create the present, and by knowing the influences of the present one can see the cyclical influences of the future.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEven in the 19th century, there was Maya influence in the local branch of Christianity followed in Chan Santa Cruz. Among the K&#39;iche&#39;s in the western highlands of Guatemala these same nine months are replicated, until this very day, in the training of the ajk&#39;ij, the keeper of the 260-day-calendar called ch&#39;olk&#39;ij.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n</font>\r\n<div style="text-align: center">\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n<div align="center">\r\n<br />\r\n</div>\r\n', 29, 2, 1189971471, 'theory', 1, 18, 'a:6:{s:13:"show_headline";s:1:"0";s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";s:14:"reentry_action";b:0;s:17:"complete_question";i:0;}', NULL, NULL, 1, ''),

The information which supports this theory comes from a folk tale that deals with the Orion constellation&#39;s area of the sky. Their traditional hearths include in their middle a smudge of glowing fire that corresponds with the Orion Nebula. This is a significant clue to support the idea that the Maya detected a diffuse area of the sky contrary to the pin points of stars before the telescope was invented.

Instead, the Maya calendar(s) were based on a year length of exactly 365 days, which means that the calendar falls out of step with the seasons by one day every four years. By comparison, the Julian calendar, used in Europe from Roman times until about the 16th Century, accumulated an error of one day every 128 years.

It is most often classified as a logographic or (more properly) a logosyllabic writing system, in which syllabic signs play a significant role. It is the only writing system of the Pre-Columbian New World which is known to completely represent the spoken language of its community. In total, the script has more than a thousand different glyphs, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than around 500 glyphs were in use, some 200 of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nThe earliest inscriptions in an identifiably-Maya script date back to 200–300 BC. However, this is preceded by several other writing systems which had developed in Mesoamerica, most notably that of the Zapotecs, and (following the 2006 publication of research on the recently-discovered Cascajal Block), the Olmecs. There is a pre-Maya writing known as &quot;Epi-Olmec script&quot; (post Olmec) which some researchers believe may represent a transitional script between Olmec and Maya writing, but the relationships between these remain unclear and the matter is unsettled. On January 5, 2006, National Geographic published the findings of Maya writings that could be as old as 400 BCE, suggesting that the Maya writing system is nearly as old as the oldest Mesoamerican writing known at that time, Zapotec. In the succeeding centuries the Maya developed their script into a form which was far more complete and complex than any other that has yet been found in the Americas.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nSince its inception, the Maya script was in use up to the arrival of the Europeans, peaking during the Maya Classical Period (c. 200 to 900). Although many Maya centers went into decline (or were completely abandoned) during or after this period, the skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted amongst segments of the population, and the early Spanish conquistadors knew of individuals who could still read and write the script. Unfortunately, the Spanish displayed little interest in it, and as a result of the dire impacts the conquest had on Maya societies, the knowledge was subsequently lost, probably within only a few generations.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nAt a rough estimate, in excess of 10,000 individual texts have so far been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramic pottery. The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark, in particular from several species of strangler fig trees such as Ficus cotinifolia and Ficus padifolia. This paper, common throughout Mesoamerica and generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl, was typically bound as a single continuous sheet that was folded into pages of equal width, concertina-style, to produce a codex (book) that could be written on both sides. Shortly after the conquest, all of the codices which could be found were ordered to be burnt and destroyed by zealous Spanish priests, notably Bishop Diego de Landa. Only three reasonably intact examples of Maya codices are known to have survived through to the present day. These are now known as the Madrid, Dresden, and Paris codices. A few pages survive from a fourth, the Grolier codex, whose authenticity is sometimes disputed, but mostly is held to be genuine. Further archaeology conducted at Mayan sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which formerly were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nThe decipherment and recovery of the now-lost knowledge of Maya writing has been a long and laborious process. Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy. Major breakthroughs came starting in the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter. By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts to a large extent, and recent field work continues to further illuminate the content.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nIn reference to the few extant Maya writings, Michael D.

The inscriptions on the stelae mainly record the dynasties and wars of the sites&#39; rulers. Also of note are the inscriptions that reveal information about the lives of ancient Maya women. Much of the remainder of Maya hieroglyphics has been found on funeral pottery, most of which describes the afterlife.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n<strong>Writing tools</strong></font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nAlthough the archaeological record does not provide examples, Maya art shows that writing was done with brushes made with animal hair and quills.

However, the process of rebuilding on top of old structures is indeed a common one. Most notably, the North Acropolis at Tikal seems to be the sum total of 1,500 years of architectural modifications. In Tikal and Yaxhá, there are the Twin Pyramid complexes (7 in Tikal and 1 in Yaxhá, that commemorate the end of a Baktún</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nThrough observation of the numerous consistent elements and stylistic distinctions, remnants of Maya architecture have become an important key to understanding the evolution of their ancient civilization.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n<strong>Urban design</strong></font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nAs Maya cities spread throughout the varied geography of Mesoamerica, site planning appears to have been minimal. Maya architecture tended to integrate a great degree of natural features, and their cities were built somewhat haphazardly as dictated by the topography of each independent location. For instance, some cities on the flat limestone plains of the northern Yucatán grew into great sprawling municipalities, while others built in the hills of Usumacinta utilized the natural loft of the topography to raise their towers and temples to impressive heights. However, some semblance of order, as required by any large city, still prevailed.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nClassic Era Maya urban design could easily be described as the division of space by great monuments and causeways. Open public plazas were the gathering places for people and the focus of urban design, while interior space was entirely secondary. Only in the Late Post-Classic era did the great Maya cities develop into more fortress-like defensive structures that lacked, for the most part, the large and numerous plazas of the Classic.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nAt the onset of large-scale construction during the Classic Era, a predetermined axis was typically established in a cardinal direction. Depending on the location of natural resources such as fresh-water wells, or cenotes, the city grew by using sacbeob (causeways), (singular: Sacbé) to connect great plazas with the numerous platforms that created the sub-structure for nearly all Maya buildings. As more structures were added and existing structures re-built or remodeled, the great Maya cities seemed to take on an almost random identity that contrasted sharply with other great Mesoamerican cities such as Teotihuacan and its rigid grid-like construction.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nAt the heart of the Maya city were large plazas surrounded by the most important governmental and religious buildings, such as the royal acropolis, great pyramid temples and occasionally ball-courts. Though city layouts evolved as nature dictated, careful attention was placed on the directional orientation of temples and observatories so that they were constructed in accordance with Maya interpretation of the orbits of the heavenly bodies. Immediately outside of this ritual center were the structures of lesser nobles, smaller temples, and individual shrines; the less sacred and less important structures had a greater degree of privacy. Outside of the constantly evolving urban core were the less permanent and more modest homes of the common people.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n<strong>Building materials</strong></font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\nA surprising aspect of the great Maya structures is their lack of many advanced technologies seemingly necessary for such constructions. Lacking draft animals necessary for wheel-based modes of transportation, metal tools and even pulleys, Maya architecture required abundant manpower. Yet, beyond this enormous requirement, the remaining materials seem to have been readily available. All stone for Maya structures appears to have been taken from local quarries. They most often used limestone which remained pliable enough to be worked with stone tools while being quarried and only hardened once removed from its bed. In addition to the structural use of limestone, much of their mortar consisted of crushed, burnt and mixed limestone that mimicked the properties of cement and was used as widely for stucco finishing as it was for mortar. Later improvements in quarrying techniques reduced the necessity for this limestone-stucco as the stones began to fit quite perfectly, yet it remained a crucial element in some post and lintel roofs. In the case of the common Maya houses, wooden poles, adobe and thatch were the primary materials; however, instances of what appear to be common houses of limestone have been discovered as well. Also notable throughout Maya architecture is the corbel arch (also known as a &quot;false arch&quot;), whose limitations kept their structures generally weighty rather than airy.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n<strong>Notable constructions</strong></font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* Ceremonial platforms were commonly limestone platforms of typically less than four meters in height where public ceremonies and religious rites were performed. Constructed in the fashion of a typical foundation platform, these were often accented by carved figures, altars and perhaps tzompantli, a stake used to display the heads of victims or defeated Mesoamerican ballgame opponents.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* Palaces were large and often highly decorated, and usually sat close to the center of a city and housed the population&#39;s elite. Any exceedingly large royal palace, or one consisting of many chambers on different levels might be referred to as an acropolis. However, often these were one-story and consisted of many small chambers and typically at least one interior courtyard; these structures appear to take into account the needed functionality required of a residence, as well as the decoration required for their inhabitants stature.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* E-Groups are specific structural configurations present at a number of centers in the Maya area. These complexes are oriented and aligned according to specific astronomical events (primarily the sun’s solstices and equinoxes) and are thought to have been observatories. These structures are usually accompanied by iconographic reliefs that tie astronomical observation into general Maya mythology. The structural complex is named for Group E at Uaxactun, the first documented in Mesoamerica.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* Pyramids and temples. Often the most important religious temples sat atop the towering Maya pyramids, presumably as the closest place to the heavens. While recent discoveries point toward the extensive use of pyramids as tombs, the temples themselves seem to rarely, if ever, contain burials. Residing atop the pyramids, some of over two-hundred feet, such as that at El Mirador, the temples were impressive and decorated structures themselves. Commonly topped with a roof comb, or superficial grandiose wall, these temples might have served as a type of propaganda. As they were often the only structure in a Maya city to exceed the height of the surrounding jungle, the roof combs atop the temples were often carved with representations of rulers that could be seen from vast distances.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* Observatories. The Maya were keen astronomers and had mapped out the phases of celestial objects, especially the Moon and Venus. Many temples have doorways and other features aligning to celestial events. Round temples, often dedicated to Kukulcan, are perhaps those most often described as &quot;observatories&quot; by modern ruin tour-guides, but there is no evidence that they were so used exclusively, and temple pyramids of other shapes may well have been used for observation as well.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n* Ball courts. As an integral aspect of the Mesoamerican lifestyle, the courts for their ritual ball-game were constructed throughout the Maya realm and often on a grand scale. Enclosed on two sides by stepped ramps that led to ceremonial platforms or small temples, the ball court itself was of a capital &quot;I&quot; shape and could be found in all but the smallest of Maya cities.</font><br />\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font><br />\r\n</div>\r\n<font size="2">\r\n</font>\r\n', 29, 2, 1189970952, 'theory', 1, 19, 'b:0;', NULL, NULL, 1, ''),

The Maya cities of the northern lowlands in Yucatán continued to flourish for centuries more; some of the important sites in this era were Chichen Itza, Uxmal, Edzná, and Coba. After the decline of the ruling dynasties of Chichen and Uxmal, Mayapan ruled all of Yucatán until a revolt in 1450. (This city&#39;s name may be the source of the word &quot;Maya&quot;, which had a more geographically restricted meaning in Yucatec and colonial Spanish and only grew to its current meaning in the 19th and 20th centuries).

It ruled over an area extending across the Peten Lakes region, encompassing the community of Eckixil on Lake Quexil. The Ko&#39;woj had their capital at Zacpeten. Postclassic Maya states also continued to survive in the southern highlands.

The first meaning of the verb to debug is to\r\n			remove errors, but the meaning that really matters is to see into the execution of a program by examining\r\n			it. A programmer that cannot debug effectively is blind.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Idealists that think design, or analysis, or complexity theory, or whatnot, are more fundamental are\r\n			not working programmers. The working programmer does not live in an ideal world. Even if you\r\n			are perfect, your are surrounded by and must interact with code written by major software companies,\r\n			organizations like GNU, and your colleagues. Most of this code is imperfect and imperfectly\r\n			documented. Without the ability to gain visibility into the execution of this code the slightest\r\n			bump will throw you permanently. Often this visibility can only be gained by experimentation,\r\n			that is, debugging.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Debugging is about the running of programs, not programs themselves. If you buy something from\r\n			a major software company, you usually don&#39;t get to see the program. But there will still arise\r\n			places where the code does not conform to the documentation (crashing your entire machine is a\r\n			common and spectacular example), or where the documentation is mute. More commonly, you\r\n			create an error, examine the code you wrote and have no clue how the error can be occurring. Inevitably,\r\n			this means some assumption you are making is not quite correct, or some condition arises\r\n			that you did not anticipate. Sometimes the magic trick of staring into the source code works. When\r\n			it doesn&#39;t, you must debug.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			To get visibility into the execution of a program you must be able to execute the code and observe\r\n			something about it. Sometimes this is visible, like what is being displayed on a screen, or the delay\r\n			between two events. In many other cases, it involves things that are not meant to be visible, like\r\n			the state of some variables inside the code, which lines of code are actually being executed, or\r\n			whether certain assertions hold across a complicated data structure. These hidden things must be\r\n			revealed.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The common ways of looking into the ‘innards’ of an executing program can be categorized as:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			• Using a debugging tool,<br />\r\n			• Printlining --- Making a temporary modification to the program, typically adding lines that\r\n			print information out, and<br />\r\n			• Logging --- Creating a permanent window into the programs execution in the form of a log.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Debugging tools are wonderful when they are stable and available, but the printlining and logging\r\n			are even more important. Debugging tools often lag behind language development, so at any point\r\n			in time they may not be available. In addition, because the debugging tool may subtly change the\r\n			way the program executes it may not always be practical. Finally, there are some kinds of debugging,\r\n			such as checking an assertion against a large data structure, that require writing code and\r\n			changing the execution of the program. It is good to know how to use debugging tools when they\r\n			are stable, but it is critical to be able to employ the other two methods.\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Some beginners fear debugging when it requires modifying code. This is understandable---it is a\r\n			little like exploratory surgery. But you have to learn to poke at the code and make it jump; you\r\n			have to learn to experiment on it, and understand that nothing that you temporarily do to it will\r\n			make it worse. If you feel this fear, seek out a mentor---we lose a lot of good programmers at the\r\n			delicate onset of their learning to this fear.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 3, 1222681063, 'theory', 1, 0, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:17:"1.

If\r\n			there is a single key to debugging is to use the divide and conquer technique on the mystery.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Suppose, for example, you created a program that should do ten things in a sequence. When you\r\n			run it, it crashes. Since you didn&#39;t program it to crash, you now have a mystery. When out look at\r\n			the output, you see that the first seven things in the sequence were run successfully. The last three\r\n			are not visible from the output, so now your mystery is smaller: ‘It crashed on thing #8, #9, or\r\n			#10.’<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Can you design an experiment to see which thing it crashed on? Sure. You can use a debugger or\r\n			we can add printline statements (or the equivalent in whatever language you are working in) after\r\n			#8 and #9. When we run it again, our mystery will be smaller, such as ‘It crashed on thing #9.’ I\r\n			find that bearing in mind exactly what the mystery is at any point in time helps keep one focused.\r\n			When several people are working together under pressure on a problem it is easy to forget what\r\n			the most important mystery is.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The key to divide and conquer as a debugging technique is the same as it is for algorithm design:\r\n			as long as you do a good job splitting the mystery in the middle, you won&#39;t have to split it too\r\n			many times, and you will be debugging quickly. But what is the middle of a mystery? There is\r\n			where true creativity and experience comes in.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			To a true beginner, the space of all possible errors looks like every line in the source code. You\r\n			don&#39;t have the vision you will later develop to see the other dimensions of the program, such as the\r\n			space of executed lines, the data structure, the memory management, the interaction with foreign\r\n			code, the code that is risky, and the code that is simple. For the experience programmer, these\r\n			other dimensions form an imperfect but very useful mental model of all the things that can go\r\n			wrong. Having that mental model is what helps one find the middle of the mystery effectively.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Once you have evenly subdivided the space of all that can go wrong, you must try to decide in\r\n			which space the error lies. In the simple case where the mystery is: ‘Which single unknown line\r\n			makes my program crash?’, you can ask yourself: ‘Is the unknown line executed before or after\r\n			this line that I judge to be executed in the about the middle of the running program?’ Usually you\r\n			will not be so lucky as to know that the error exists in a single line, or even a single block. Often\r\n			the mystery will be more like: ‘Either there is a pointer in that graph that points to the wrong node,\r\n			or my algorithm that adds up the variables in that graph doesn&#39;t work.’ In that case you may have\r\n			to write a small program to check that the pointers in the graph are all correct in order to decide\r\n			which part of the subdivided mystery can be eliminated.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 3, 1222681105, 'theory', 1, 31, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:45:"2.How to Debug by Splitting the Problem Space";s:7:"creator";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:9:"publisher";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:11:"contributor";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:4:"date";s:10:"2008/09/29";}', NULL, 1, '');

Printlining is just producing a simple, usually temporary, log. Absolute beginners\r\n			must understand and use logs because their knowledge of the programming is limited; system architects\r\n			must understand and use logs because of the complexity of the system. The amount of information\r\n			that is provided by the log should be configurable, ideally while the program is running.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			In general, logs offer three basic advantages:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			• Logs can provide useful information about bugs that are hard to reproduce (such as those that\r\n			occur in the production environment but that cannot be reproduced in the test environment).<br />\r\n			• Logs can provide statistics and data relevant to performance, such as the time passing between\r\n			statements.<br />\r\n			• When configurable, logs allow general information to be captured in order to debug unanticipated\r\n			specific problems without having to modify and/or redeploy the code just to deal with\r\n			those specific problems.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			The amount to output into the log is always a compromise between information and brevity. Too\r\n			much information makes the log expensive and produces scroll blindness, making it hard to find\r\n			the information you need. Too little information and it may not contain what you need. For this\r\n			reason, making what is output configurable is very useful. Typically, each record in the log will\r\n			identify its position in the source code, the thread that executed it if applicable, the precise time of\r\n			execution, and, commonly, an additional useful piece of information, such as the value of some\r\n			variable, the amount of free memory, the number of data objects, etc. These log statements are\r\n			sprinkled throughout the source code but are particularly at major functionality points and around\r\n			risky code.

Before you\r\n			try to make it faster, you must build a mental model of why it is slow. To do this you can use a\r\n			profiling tool or a good log to figure out where the time or other resources are really being spent.\r\n			There is a famous dictum that 90% of the time will be spent in 10% of the code. I would add to\r\n			that the importance of input/output expense (I/O) to performance issues. Often most of the time is\r\n			spent in I/O in one way or another. Finding the expensive I/O and the expensive 10% of the code\r\n			is a good first step to building your mental model.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			There are many dimensions to the performance of a computer system, and many resources consumed.\r\n			The first resource to measure is wall--clock time, the total time that passes for the computation.\r\n			Logging wall-clock time is particularly valuable because it can inform about unpredictable\r\n			circumstance that arise in situations where other profiling is impractical.

For instance, if you are reading some data from a database and\r\n			computing something simple from it, such as a summation, try to get the database server to do it\r\n			for you.

If you can&#39;t reproduce it, set a trap for it by\r\n			building a logging system, a special one if you have to, that can log what you guess you need\r\n			when it really does occur. Resign yourself to that if the bug only occurs in production and not at\r\n			your whim, this is may be a long process. The hints that you get from the log may not provide the\r\n			solution but may give you enough information to improve the logging.

I simply forgot to synchronize the garbage collector. The system could run a long time, often\r\n			finishing whatever task I began, before anything noticeable went wrong.

Since we had four threads, this was not in itself a giant\r\n			problem---unless all four got stuck. Then the queues emptied by these threads would quickly fill\r\n			up all available memory and crash our server. It took us about a week to figure this much out, and\r\n			we still didn&#39;t know what caused it, when it would happen, or even what the threads where doing\r\n			when they got ‘stuck’.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			This illustrates some risk associated with third-party software.

It also takes labor. It takes so much labor it may be a good idea to estimate\r\n			the time it will take to make the estimate, especially if you are asked to estimate something\r\n			big.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			When asked to provide an estimate of something big, the most honest thing to do is to stall. Most\r\n			engineers are enthusiastic and eager to please, and stalling certainly will displease the stalled. But\r\n			an on-the-spot estimate probably won&#39;t be accurate and honest.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			While stalling, it may be possible to consider doing or prototyping the task. If political pressure\r\n			permits, this is the most accurate way of producing the estimate, and it makes real progress.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			When not possible to take the time for some investigation, you should first establish the meaning\r\n			of the estimate very clearly. Restate that meaning as the first and last part of your written estimate.\r\n			Prepare a written estimate by deconstructing the task into progressively smaller subtasks until each\r\n			small task is no more than a day; ideally at most in length. The most important thing is not to leave\r\n			anything out. For instance, documentation, testing, time for planning, time for communicating\r\n			with other groups, and vacation time are all very important. If you spend part of each day dealing\r\n			with knuckleheads, put a line item for that in the estimate. This gives your boss visibility into what\r\n			is using up your time at a minimum, and might get you more time.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			I know good engineers who pad estimates implicitly, but I recommend that you do not. One of the\r\n			results of padding is trust in you may be depleted. For instance, an engineer might estimate three\r\n			days for a task that she truly thinks will take one day. The engineer may plan to spend two days\r\n			documenting it, or two days working on some other useful project. But it will be detectable that\r\n			the task was done in only one day (if it turns out that way), and the appearance of slacking or overestimating\r\n			is born. It&#39;s far better to give proper visibility into what you are actually doing. If documentation\r\n			takes twice as long as coding and the estimate says so, tremendous advantage is gained\r\n			by making this visible to the manager.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Pad explicitly instead. If a task will probably take one day---but might take ten days if your approach\r\n			doesn&#39;t work---note this somehow in the estimate if you can; if not, at least do an average\r\n			weighted by your estimates of the probabilities. Any risk factor that you can identify and assign an\r\n			estimate to should go into the schedule. One person is unlikely to be sick in any given week. But a\r\n			large project with many engineers will have some sick time; likewise vacation time. And what is\r\n			the probability of a mandatory company-wide training seminar? If it can be estimated, stick it in.\r\n			There are of course, unknown unknowns, or unk-unks. Unk-unks by definition cannot be estimated\r\n			individually. You can try to create a global line item for all unk-unks, or handle them in some\r\n			other way that you communicate to your boss. You cannot, however, let your boss forget that they\r\n			exist, and it is devilishly easy for an estimate to become a schedule without the unk-unks considered.\r\n			<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			In a team environment, you should try to have the people who will do the work do the estimate,\r\n			and you should try to have team-wide consensus on estimates. People vary widely in skill, experience,\r\n			preparedness, and confidence. Calamity strikes when a strong programmer estimates for herself\r\n			and then weak programmers are held to this estimate. The act of having the whole team agree\r\n			on a line-by-line basis to the estimate clarifies the team understanding, as well as allowing the opportunity\r\n			for tactical reassignment of resources (for instance, shifting burden away from weaker\r\n			team members to stronger).<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			If there are big risks that cannot be evaluated, it is your duty to state so forcefully enough that your\r\n			manager does not commit to them and then become embarrassed when the risk occurs. Hopefully\r\n			in such a case whatever is needed will be done to decrease the risk.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			If you can convince your company to use Extreme Programming, you will only have to estimate\r\n			relatively small things, and this is both more fun and more productive.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 3, 1222681915, 'theory', 1, 43, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:36:"14.

Furthermore, the particular costs and benefits derived differ from person to person.\r\n			I strongly believe that an executive of 100 people should spend five minutes a month talking\r\n			to each person in her organization, which would be about 5% of their time. But ten minutes might\r\n			be too much, and five minutes is too much if they have one thousand employees. The amount of\r\n			time you spend talking to each person in your organization depends on their role (more than their\r\n			position).

The unfortunate fact is that it is not a culture that values mental or physical health very much. For both cultural/historical reasons (the\r\n			need to work at night on unloaded computers, for example) and because of overwhelming timeto-\r\n			market pressure and the scarcity of programmers, computer programmers are traditionally overworked.\r\n			I don&#39;t think you can trust all the stories you hear, but I think 60 hours a week is common,\r\n			and 50 is pretty much a minimum. This means that often much more than that is required. This is\r\n			serious problem for a good programmer, who is responsible not only for themselves but their\r\n			teammates as well. You have to recognize when to go home, and sometimes when to suggest that\r\n			other people go home. There can&#39;t be any fixed rules for solving this problem, anymore than there\r\n			can be fixed rules for raising a child, for the same reason---every human being is different.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Beyond 60 hours a week is an extraordinary effort for me, which I can apply for short periods of\r\n			time (about one week), and that is sometimes expected of me. I don&#39;t know if it is fair to expect 60\r\n			hours of work from a person; I don&#39;t even know if 40 is fair. I am sure, however, that it is stupid to\r\n			work so much that you are getting little out of that extra hour you work. For me personally, that&#39;s\r\n			any more than 60 hours a week. I personally think a programmer should exercise noblesse oblige\r\n			and shoulder a heavy burden. However, it is not a programmer&#39;s duty to be a patsy. The sad fact is\r\n			programmers are often asked to be patsies in order to put on a show for somebody, for example a\r\n			manager trying to impress an executive. Programmers often succumb to this because they are eager\r\n			to please and not very good at saying no. There are four defenses against this:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			• Communicate as much as possible with everyone in the company so that no one can mislead\r\n			the executives about what is going on,<br />\r\n			• Learn to estimate and schedule defensively and explicitly and give everyone visibility into\r\n			what the schedule is and where it stands,<br />\r\n			• Learn to say no, and say no as a team when necessary, and<br />\r\n			• Quit if you have to.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Most programmers are good programmers, and good programmers want to get a lot done. To do\r\n			that, they have to manage their time effectively. There is a certain amount of mental inertia associated\r\n			with getting warmed-up to a problem and deeply involved in it. Many programmers find they\r\n			work best when they have long, uninterrupted blocks of time in which to get warmed-up and concentrate.\r\n			However, people must sleep and perform other duties. Each person needs to find a way to\r\n			satisfy both their human rhythm and their work rhythm. Each programmer needs to do whatever it\r\n			takes to procure efficient work periods, such as reserving certain days in which you will attend\r\n			only the most critical meetings.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Since I have children, I try to spend evenings with them sometimes. The rhythm that works best\r\n			for me is to work a very long day, sleep in the office or near the office (I have a long commute\r\n			from home to work) then go home early enough the next day to spend time with my children before\r\n			they go to bed. I am not comfortable with this, but it is the best compromise I have been able\r\n			to work out. Go home if you have a contagious disease. You should go home if you are thinking\r\n			suicidal thoughts. You should take a break or go home if you think homicidal thoughts for more\r\n			than a few seconds. You should send someone home if they show serious mental malfunctioning\r\n			or signs of mental illness beyond mild depression. If you are tempted to be dishonest or deceptive\r\n			in a way that you normally are not due to fatigue, you should take a break. Don&#39;t use cocaine or\r\n			amphetamines to combat fatigue.

This is worth bearing\r\n			in mind when communicating with non-engineers; you should always understand the audience.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Non-engineers are smart, but not as grounded in creating technical things as we are. We make\r\n			things. They sell things and handle things and count things and manage things, but they are not experts\r\n			on making things.

This represents a great\r\n			opportunity to synergize with them.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			When talking to your team you will, without thinking, use a sort of shorthand, an abbreviated language\r\n			that is effective because you will have much shared experience about technology in general\r\n			and your product in particular. It takes some effort not to use this shorthand with those that don&#39;t\r\n			have that shared experience, especially when members of your own team are present. This vocabulary\r\n			create a wall between you and those that do not share it, and, even worse, wastes their time.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			With your team, the basic assumptions and goals do not need to be restated often, and most conversation\r\n			focuses on the details. With outsiders, it must be the other way around. They may not\r\n			understand things you take for granted. Since you take them for granted and don&#39;t repeat them, you\r\n			can leave a conversation with an outsider thinking that you understand each other when really\r\n			there is a large misunderstanding.

Try to get them to summarize or paraphrase what you are\r\n			saying to make sure they understand. If you have the opportunity to meet with them often, spend a\r\n			little bit of time asking if you you are communicating effectively, and how you can do it better.

You should carefully choose how abstract you need to be. Beginning\r\n			programmers in their enthusiasm often create more abstraction than is really useful. One\r\n			sign of this is if you create classes that don&#39;t really contain any code and don&#39;t really do anything\r\n			except serve to abstract something. The attraction of this is understandable but the value of code\r\n			brevity must be measured against the value of abstraction. Occasionally, one sees a mistake made\r\n			by enthusiastic idealists: at the start of the project a lot of classes are defined that seem wonderfully\r\n			abstract and one may speculate that they will handle every eventuality that may arise. As the\r\n			project progresses and fatigue sets in, the code itself becomes messy. Function bodies become\r\n			longer than they should be. The empty classes are a burden to document that is ignored when under\r\n			pressure. The final result would have been better if the energy spent on abstraction had been\r\n			spent on keeping things short and simple. This is a form of speculative programming. I strongly\r\n			recommend the article ``Succinctness is Power&#39;&#39; by Paul Graham[PGSite].<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			There is a certain dogma associated with useful techniques such as information hiding and object\r\n			oriented programming that are sometimes taken too far. These techniques let one code abstractly\r\n			and anticipate change. I personally think, however, that you should not produce much speculative\r\n			code. For example, it is an accepted style to hide an integer variable on an object behind mutators\r\n			and accessors, so that the variable itself is not exposed, only the little interface to it. This does allow\r\n			the implementation of that variable to be changed without affecting the calling code, and is\r\n			perhaps appropriate to a library writer who must publish a very stable API. But I don&#39;t think the\r\n			benefit of this outweighs the cost of the wordiness of it when my team owns the calling code and\r\n			hence can recode the caller as easily as the called. Four or five extra lines of code is a heavy price\r\n			to pay for this speculative benefit.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Portability poses a similar problem. Should code be portable to a different computer, compiler,\r\n			software system or platform, or simply easily ported? I think a non-portable, shortand-\r\n			easily-ported piece of code is better than a long portable one. It is relatively easy and certainly\r\n			a good idea to confine non-portable code to designated areas, such as a class that makes database\r\n			queries that are specific to a given DBMS.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 4, 1222697772, 'theory', 1, 74, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:41:"5.

At first it appears that the purpose of stress testing is to find out if the system\r\n			works under a load. In reality, it is common that the system does work under a load but fails to\r\n			work in some way when the load is heavy enough. I call this hitting the wall or bonking. There\r\n			may be some exceptions, but there is almost always a ‘wall’. The purpose of stress testing is to\r\n			figure out where the wall is, and then figure out how to move the wall further out.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			A plan for stress testing should be developed early in the project, because it often helps to clarify\r\n			exactly what is expected. Is two seconds for a web page request a miserable failure or a smashing\r\n			success? Is 500 concurrent users enough? That, of course, depends, but one must know the answer\r\n			when designing the system that answers the request. The stress test needs to model reality well\r\n			enough to be useful. It isn&#39;t really possible to simulate 500 erratic and unpredictable humans using\r\n			a system concurrently very easily, but one can at least create 500 simulations and try to model\r\n			some part of what they might do.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			In stress testing, start out with a light load and load the system along some dimension---such as input\r\n			rate or input size---until you hit the wall. If the wall is too close to satisfy your needs, figure\r\n			out which resource is the bottleneck (there is usually a dominant one.) Is it memory, processor, Input/\r\n			Output, network bandwidth, or data contention? Then figure out how you can move the wall.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Note that moving the wall, that is, increasing the maximum load the system can handle, might not\r\n			help or might actually hurt the performance of a lightly loaded system. Usually performance under\r\n			heavy load is more important than performance under a light load.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			You may have to get visibility into several different dimensions to build up a mental model of it;\r\n			no single technique is sufficient. For instance, logging often gives a good idea of the wall-clock\r\n			time between two events in the system, but unless carefully constructed, doesn&#39;t give visibility into\r\n			memory utilization or even data structure size. Similarly, in a modern system, a number of computers\r\n			and many software systems may be cooperating. Particularly when you are hitting the wall\r\n			(that is, the performance is non-linear in the size of the input) these other software systems may be\r\n			a bottleneck. Visibility into these systems, even if only measuring the processor load on all participating\r\n			machines, can be very helpful.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Knowing where the wall is is essential not only to moving the wall, but also to providing predictability\r\n			so that the business can be managed effectively.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 4, 1222697575, 'theory', 1, 77, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:21:"4.

Later, it dies and its body feeds other organisms.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			We have the luxury of treating software like that. A bridge is not like that; there is never a baby\r\n			bridge, but merely an unfinished bridge.

Generally, this\r\n			issue is dictated by pointy-haired bosses who are making a political decision, rather than a technological\r\n			decision, and lack the courage to promote an unconventional tool even when they know,\r\n			often with firsthand knowledge, that the less accepted tool is best. In other cases the very real benefit\r\n			of unity among the team, and to some extent with a larger community, precludes choice on the\r\n			part of the individual. Often managers are driven by the need to be able to hire programmers with\r\n			experience in a given language. No doubt they are serving what they perceive to be the best interests\r\n			of the project or company, and must be respected for that. However, I personally believe this\r\n			the most wasteful and erroneous common practice you are likely to encounter.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			But of course, things are never one-dimensional. Even if a core language is mandated and beyond\r\n			your control, it is often the case that tools and other programs can and should be written in a different\r\n			language. If a language is to be embedded (and you should always consider it!) the choice\r\n			of language will depend a lot on the culture of the users. One should take advantage of this to\r\n			serve your company or project by using the best language for the job, and in so doing make work\r\n			more interesting.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Programming languages should really be called notations in that learning one is not at all as difficult\r\n			as learning a natural language. To beginners and to some outsiders ``learning a new language&#39;&#39;\r\n			seems a daunting task; but after you have three under your belt it&#39;s really just a question of becoming\r\n			familiar with the available libraries. One tends to think of a large system that has components\r\n			in three or four languages as a messy hodgepodge; but I argue that such a system is in many cases\r\n			stronger than a one-language system in several ways:<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			• There is necessarily loose coupling between the components that are written in different notations\r\n			(though maybe not clean interfaces),<br />\r\n			• You can evolve to a new language/platform easily by rewriting each component individually,<br />\r\n			• Its possible that some of the modules are actually up-to-date.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			Some of these effects may only be psychological; but psychology matters. In the end the costs of\r\n			language tyranny outweigh any advantage that it provides.\r\n			</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n', 0, 5, 1222769173, 'theory', 1, 95, 'a:3:{s:18:"hide_complete_unit";s:1:"0";s:15:"hide_navigation";s:1:"0";s:7:"indexed";s:1:"0";}', 'a:5:{s:5:"title";s:18:"Choosing Languages";s:7:"creator";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:9:"publisher";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:11:"contributor";s:15:"George Goudelis";s:4:"date";s:10:"2008/09/30";}', NULL, 1, ''),

From the point of view of most working\r\n			programmers, something is impossible if either it cannot be grown from a simple system or it cannot\r\n			be estimated. By this definition what is called research is impossible.

Of course, use of the language can be made optional,\r\n			as it is in text editors, so that initiates can use it and no one else has to.<br />\r\n			<br />\r\n			I and many other programmers have fallen into the trap of creating special purpose embedded languages.\r\n			I fell into it twice.

It is a joy to create a new language. But we should not let that blind us to\r\n			the needs of the user.
